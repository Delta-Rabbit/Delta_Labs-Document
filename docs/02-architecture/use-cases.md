# Use Cases

**Purpose:** Single place for *who does what* in Delta Labs — by actor and by flow. Keeps product, QA, and implementation aligned. Fill in as the system is defined; structure is flexible.

---

## How to use this doc

- **By actor** — e.g. Student, Teacher, Admin, Parent, Lab assistant, Content creator. Add or remove actors as needed.
- **By flow** — end-to-end flows (e.g. Enroll in course, Checkout, Book lab). Add flows as you document them.
- **By domain** — optional grouping (Catalog, Learning, Commerce, Labs, Identity, etc.) if that fits better later.

Extend sections and add subsections freely; no fixed template.
